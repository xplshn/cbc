# (cbc) | The C B Compiler

This compiler is a project aiming to make a valid B compiler, with _optional_ extensions for C interoperability, and a modules system like Go's

The project is currently in its infancy, and the long-term goals are very ambitious. This is the current roadmap:

> ##### ROADMAP
>
> ###### (i) Tests
> * Make a script that takes the tests from [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b), and filters the tests.json to only include the IR tests
> * Make a Go program that runs each test, displays the passing/failing ones
>
> ###### (ii) Compatibility with [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)
> 1. Support the "extrn" keyword, as well as inline assembly
> 2. Use the same warning & error messages [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)
> 3. Be able to pass the IR tests of [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)
>
> ###### (iii) Packages / Modules inspired by Go
> * Â¿.. Namespaces based on .mod file ..?
> * Implement a way to import/export symbols from different .B files, in different namespaces
>
